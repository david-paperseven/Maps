He is often associated with the loose group of visual artists, the Young British Artists (YBAs). Turk gained notoriety in 1991 when, as his submission for his MA show at the Royal Academy of Art, he unveiled 'Cave' which consisted of a whitewashed wall with a single blue plaque that read: 'Gavin Turk, Sculptor worked here 1989-1991'. Famously, Turk's tutors refused to award him a degree, but it brought him to the attention of the influential  art collector  Charles Saatchi. Ironically Turk commemorated himself before his career had truly begun, yet paradoxically launched his career at the same time and  is now commemorated with a genuine blue plaque.",,100,,Charles,Dickens,1812-1870,48 Doughty Street,Holborn,51.5236,-0.116391,Arts,,Writer,,Charles Dickens 1812-1870 Novelist lived here,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickens,"Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was an English writer who is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period; he was responsible for some of English literature's most iconic stories and characters. Thrust into poverty at an early age, Dickens drew much inspiration for his novels 'Great Expectations' and 'David Copperfield' from the appalling conditions he experienced working in a factory as a boy. His work has never been out of print and his novel 'A Christmas Carol' has sold over 200 million copies since its publication in 1859. Dickens and his family lived at 48 Doughty Street from 1837 to 1839, and it was here that his sister-in-law Mary died in his arms after a brief illness - his memories of her inspired several characters in his novels, notably Little Nell in 'The Old Curiosity Shop'.
